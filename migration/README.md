# Migration

This folder contains resources for testing Polkadot REVM and PVM Solidity smart contracts.

## Purpose

- Test smart contract migrations between different execution environments
- Validate Solidity contracts on Polkadot's REVM (Ethereum-compatible EVM)
- Test contracts compiled to PVM (PolkaVM) using Revive compiler

## Structure

```

├── README.md
├── contracts/     # Solidity smart contracts
├── scripts/       # Deployment and migration scripts
└── tests/         # Migration test cases
```

## Getting Started

Documentation and examples will be added as the migration testing framework develops.
