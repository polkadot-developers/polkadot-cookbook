# Polkadot Cookbook

> Build Polkadot projects with the `dot` CLI. Explore community-contributed recipes verified by automated test harnesses across smart contracts, parachains, transactions, XCM, and networks.

The Polkadot Cookbook has two main components: (1) the `dot` CLI tool for scaffolding new Polkadot projects (smart contracts, parachains, and more across 5 pathways), and (2) a collection of community-contributed recipe test harnesses that automatically clone, build, and verify external code examples work end-to-end.

## Recipe Pathways

The cookbook organizes recipes into pathways:

- **Pallets** — Verified examples of custom parachains with FRAME pallets and PAPI integration
- **Contracts** — Verified examples of Solidity smart contracts on Polkadot parachains using Hardhat
- **Transactions** — Verified examples of single-chain transaction submission and state queries via Polkadot API (PAPI)
- **XCM (Cross-Chain Messaging)** — Verified examples of cross-chain asset transfers between parachains
- **Networks** — Verified examples of testing infrastructure with Zombienet and Chopsticks

## CLI Tool

The `dot` CLI scaffolds new Polkadot projects:

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-cookbook/master/install.sh | bash

# Create a new project
dot create --title "My Project"

# Run tests
dot test
```

## Architecture

- `dot/cli/` — Rust CLI binary (interactive terminal, Git integration)
- `dot/sdk/` — Rust core library (async-first, no terminal deps, 80%+ test coverage)
- `dot/sdk/templates/` — Embedded templates used by `dot create`
- `recipes/{pathway}/{recipe-name}/` — Test harnesses that clone, build, and verify community-contributed external repos

Each recipe is an externally-owned project. The cookbook only contains test harnesses that verify these external repos. Each test harness follows a standard structure:
- `package.json` + `vitest.config.ts` + `tests/recipe.test.ts`
- Tests clone an external repo at a pinned version, install dependencies, build, and run tests

## Key Technologies

- **Polkadot SDK** — Substrate-based blockchain framework
- **PAPI (Polkadot API)** — TypeScript API for Polkadot interactions
- **FRAME** — Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities (pallet system)
- **Zombienet** — Polkadot network testing tool
- **Chopsticks** — Local chain forking tool for testing
- **Hardhat** — Ethereum/Solidity development environment (for EVM-compatible parachains)
