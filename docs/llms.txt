# Polkadot Cookbook

> Practical, tested recipes for building on Polkadot. Runtime logic, smart contracts, dApps, and cross-chain applications with working code examples.

The Polkadot Cookbook is an open-source collection of tested recipes for building on the Polkadot network. It includes a CLI tool (`dot`), an SDK, and test harnesses that verify each recipe works end-to-end.

## Recipe Pathways

The cookbook organizes recipes into pathways:

- **Pallets** — Build custom parachains with FRAME pallets and PAPI integration testing
- **Contracts** — Deploy and interact with Solidity smart contracts using Hardhat
- **Transactions** — Single-chain transaction submission and state queries via Polkadot API (PAPI)
- **XCM (Cross-Chain Messaging)** — Cross-chain asset transfers between parachains with Chopsticks testing
- **Networks** — Testing infrastructure with Zombienet and Chopsticks

## CLI Tool

The `dot` CLI scaffolds new Polkadot projects:

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-cookbook/master/install.sh | bash

# Create a new project
dot create --title "My Project"

# Run tests
dot test
```

## Architecture

- `dot/cli/` — Rust CLI binary (interactive terminal, Git integration)
- `dot/sdk/` — Rust core library (async-first, no terminal deps, 80%+ test coverage)
- `dot/sdk/templates/` — Embedded templates used by `dot create`
- `recipes/{pathway}/{recipe-name}/` — Test harnesses (clone external repos, verify they work)

Each recipe test harness follows a standard structure:
- `package.json` + `vitest.config.ts` + `tests/recipe.test.ts`
- Tests clone an external repo at a pinned version, install dependencies, build, and run tests

## Key Technologies

- **Polkadot SDK** — Substrate-based blockchain framework
- **PAPI (Polkadot API)** — TypeScript API for Polkadot interactions
- **FRAME** — Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities (pallet system)
- **Zombienet** — Polkadot network testing tool
- **Chopsticks** — Local chain forking tool for testing
- **Hardhat** — Ethereum/Solidity development environment (for EVM-compatible parachains)
